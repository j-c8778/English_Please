# English_Please  

## This script is intended to move the mouse on the primary monitor through a set of variable locations, clicking at each location, until the path is complete and a desired outcome is achieved.  
#### The main target of these commands is a specific class of items that should be in English based on the settings when accessing a free site while logging in, but are not. I do not reccomend using this function if your settings are presenting the correct type of item this is targeted at.
